# Advanced-Twitter-X-Selenium-Scraper
A robust Selenium-based scraper for Twitter (X.com) that logs in with real credentials, navigates to the “Latest” tab for a given search term, scrolls through tweets, and extracts complete tweet details including author info, timestamp, tweet text, engagement metrics (replies, reposts, likes, views), and tweet URLs. Saves data to CSV.
